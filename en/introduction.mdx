## What is this?

Linkly AI is a free AI knowledge base, a standalone AI context layer running locally.

With Linkly AI, you can:

- Build AI-native knowledge bases from any documents and directories on your computer
- Quickly retrieve accurate context to use with any AI chatbot
- Use it as a tool that can be directly accessed by AI chatbots and agents supporting protocols like MCP
- Trace knowledge sources and find the origin of references

It is not:

- Not another AI chatbot
- Not another note-taking app, you continue writing notes in your favorite note-taking software
- Not a knowledge base that requires frequent importing and switching

In short, this is a completely free, local, AI-native knowledge base. Your computer is your AI knowledge base.

<Tip>
  Linkly AI draws inspiration from the excellent lightweight knowledge base
  feature called Project in [ChatGPT](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects)
  and
  [Claude](https://support.anthropic.com/zh-CN/articles/9517075-%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%98%AF%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE).
  If you've used these products, you'll find Linkly AI very familiar.

## Who is it for?

Linkly AI is built for all **knowledge workers**, **creators**, **students**, **researchers**, and **small teams** who struggle with managing large amounts of knowledge fragments.

Have you ever faced these challenges?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Information Overload" icon="file-lines" iconType="duotone">
    PDFs, DOCXs, web pages, notes and other documents scattered everywhere,
    making them hard to find and overwhelming to read
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Time-Consuming Organization"

    iconType="duotone"
  >
    Manually classifying, tagging, and creating folders takes far more time than
    it's worth
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inefficient Search" icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone">
    Finding documents relies on memory and filenames, while the content you need
    is hidden somewhere in a file you only vaguely remember
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Knowledge Hoarding Without Utilization"
    icon="box-archive"
    iconType="duotone"
  >
    Content collected and organized with great effort remains unused, creating
    vast "knowledge inventory" that provides little value
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These problems have never been efficiently solved until the emergence of LLMs.

**LLM**, **RAG**, **Agent** and other technologies have effectively addressed the challenges of knowledge collection and utilization. However, when you use most **AI knowledge base** products on the market developed with these technologies, you'll find the following issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inaccurate Answers and Hallucinations">
    Most AI knowledge bases use only simple RAG to search document fragments,
    with poor results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concerning Data Privacy">
    Most AI knowledge bases run in the cloud, forcing us to upload our data to
    their servers. If security issues arise or service providers misuse data,
    our private information could be compromised.

    Some providers have even used user data to train their models.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Capacity and High Costs">
    Most AI knowledge bases offer only a few GB of free capacity, and require
    paid subscriptions for more features and the best models.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating New Problems">
    AI knowledge bases were meant to solve the problem of scattered knowledge
    management, but users end up having to move knowledge between multiple AI
    applications, defeating the purpose.

    Unable to manage conveniently in one place, unable to use in your most
    frequently used AI applications, always requiring extra effort for
    migration.
