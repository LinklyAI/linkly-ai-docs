## What is Linkly AI?

Linkly AI is an open-source AI knowledge base that runs locally as a desktop application.

With Linkly AI, you can:

- Have AI conversations with documents stored on your personal computer, without any limitations
- Use LLM services from any provider, or local model deployments like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- Find documents in your knowledge base using vague descriptions
- Use [DeepResearch](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) tools to research large volumes of documents and generate reports
- Simply use it as another AI chatbot, but with a more elegant interface

In essence, this is a completely free, open-source, elegant, and truly functional artificial intelligence second brain that belongs entirely to you.

<Tip>
  Linkly AI draws inspiration from the excellent lightweight knowledge base
  application called Project in
  [ChatGPT](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects) and
  [Claude](https://support.anthropic.com/zh-CN/articles/9517075-%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%98%AF%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE).
  If you've used these products, you'll find Linkly AI very familiar.

## Who is it for?

Linkly AI is built for all **knowledge workers**, **students**, **researchers**, **technical professionals**, and **small teams** who struggle with knowledge management.

Have you ever faced these challenges?

  <Card title="Information Overload" icon="file-lines" iconType="duotone">
    PDFs, DOCXs, web pages, notes and other documents scattered everywhere,
    making them hard to find and overwhelming to read

    Manually classifying, tagging, and creating folders takes far more time than
    it's worth
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inefficient Search" icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone">
    Finding documents relies on memory and filenames, while the content you need
    is hidden somewhere in a file you only vaguely remember

    Content collected and organized with great effort remains unused, creating
    vast "knowledge inventory" that provides little value
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These problems have never been efficiently solved until the emergence of AI.

**AI search** has effectively addressed the challenges of knowledge collection and quick browsing. People hoped that **AI knowledge bases** would solve the difficulties of organizing and using knowledge. However, when you use most AI knowledge base products on the market, you'll find the following issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inaccurate Answers and Hallucinations">
    Most AI knowledge bases use only simple RAG to search document fragments, with results compromised by technical limitations, costs, performance constraints, and model selection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Model Selection">
    Due to cost constraints and competition among major companies, we often can't use the best models for Q&A, significantly reducing effectiveness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concerning Data Privacy">
    Most AI knowledge bases run in the cloud, forcing us to upload our data to their servers. If security issues arise or service providers misuse data, our private information could be compromised.

    Some major companies have even blatantly used user data to train their models.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Capacity and High Costs">
    The high operational costs of AI applications are either passed on to users or result in reduced quality. Most AI knowledge bases offer only a few GB of free capacity.
    
    Many users have their own computing power (like their own GPUs) but can't use it, and struggle to freely choose model providers.

## Core Advantages

The Linkly AI development team employs leading concepts and technical architecture, committed to creating the best, future-oriented AI knowledge base application.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Local-First Approach" icon="laptop" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    Linkly AI is a client that runs entirely on your personal computer, with all data stored locally. If you can deploy models yourself, you can even run it completely offline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="github" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    Linkly AI embraces open source from Day One, based on a firm belief in the future of knowledge freedom and user sovereignty. Making the core code public means—you can personally review every line of logic to confirm that data only flows on your local machine; developers worldwide can also jointly improve performance and security, making the technology transparent and verifiable.

    Only in this way can AI enhance everyone in a safer and more controllable manner.

  <Card title="Data Security" icon="shield-check" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    Thanks to local operation and open-source strategy, Linkly AI offers absolute data security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Superior Accuracy" icon="bullseye" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    Linkly AI focuses on the knowledge base domain, implementing cutting-edge RAG, Agentic, GraphRAG, and memory technologies. Without model inference cost constraints, we can use the best technical combinations to ensure optimal Q&A results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rich Knowledge Applications" icon="brain" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    According to DIKW knowledge pyramid theory, people create knowledge bases to use them. Linkly AI includes multiple knowledge applications to help you better collect, organize, and use knowledge.

    We've organically integrated traditional readers, web clipping, and internet connectivity to help users complete data collection more conveniently and automatically.

  </Card>
  <Card title="First-Class User Experience" icon="star" horizontal="horizontal" iconType="duotone">
    A good product experience brings joy to users. We're committed to providing a powerful AI knowledge base while maintaining simplicity and elegance, without requiring users to learn excessive technical jargon, making it accessible to everyone.
